Introduction:
For this Project it was given a task by the client to research the use of parallel processing to complete the study cycle, with the following requirements:
Comparing and testing the operating speeds of sequential and parallel processing
Calculate the number of processors you'll need based on your results.
Examine how the code reacts to typical errors.
Run automatic tests that enable the client to leave the code running and check the results later without having to intervene.
